Collaborative robots (cobots) were designed for safe human-robot interaction. 
Their use has increased significantly thanks to their programming flexibility, and for that reason they are being called to perform a different range of tasks, extending the traditional applications. 
This kind of robots present a low payload capacity compared to industrial manipulators, since their weight and actuator sizes are reduced for safety reasons.
This drawback involves the need of a control strategy able to optimize the usage of the control actions in order to accomplish tasks that require the maximum exploitation of the robot dynamics, such as the throwing.

In this work the effect of concentrated elasticity in the cobot wrist for throwing small dimension objects was studied. 
The throwing motion planning is approached by defining a nonlinear optimal control problem (OCP) and solving it using the direct solution approach. 
Two kinds of throwing motion planning was formulated: the throwing motion at maximum distance and the throwing motion in a desired position.
